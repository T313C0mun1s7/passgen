# passgen
## Fast and opinionated single page password generator. 
This is a single page, PHP website that only allows 2 options:

- How many characters in the password (between 6-32)
- How many passwords you wish to generate (at least 1)
  
An attempt has been made to make the page pleasing to use and follow best practices to the best of my non-developer ability. Most of the code was written with a combination of ChatGPT 4 and Phind, with my simple human brain playing referee to ensure what came out was as usable as possible. 

It has PHP error handling on the 2 form fields in case someone submits something they should not. Copy to clipboard button are presented for conveinence. The background image was generated by DALLâ€¢E so notbody should hold any copywrite on it.

This project will not me supported or maintained by myself, and it is placed into the public domain under the Unlicense.
